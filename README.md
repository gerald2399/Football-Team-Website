## Description
This is a front-end website project I created inspired by my love and interest of highschool football and especially the team of my alma mater for years. This is a fan based highschool football website I created from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript for mobile navigation, and the lightbox JS library to display larger versions of various images on the site and logos and team historical information and records. I created and built the website in 2013 and I have been updating and maintaining it since.
